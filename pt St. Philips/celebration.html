				<p>Have a baptism coming up? <br> <br>
					Baptism is the sacrament by which a person is joined to Christ and becomes a member of the Church. The Catechism of the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer elaborates that,
				“Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ’s Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God.” The sacraments of the Episcopal Church baptizes...</p>

					    	The sacraments of the Episcopal Church baptizes both adults who have grown in their faith in Christ and
						children whose guardians present them for this celebration. Through the rite of Baptism, there begins
						an eternal bond between the person and God. Thus, once Baptized within any denomination, the
						Episcopalian Church does not require a person to be re-baptized. And, we welcome exploring with any
						baptized person membership in the Episcopal Church.

					Confirmation and reaffirmation are rites that area meant to help one renew commitments made during baptisms or made on their behalf by parents or others at baptism in the Baptismal Covenant.

Reaffirmation is for those who have been baptized and confirmed but who, for any number of reasons, want to intentionally renew their commitment to living a Christian life through study and renewal of the Baptismal Covenant vows once again. Both confirmation and reaffirmation involve strengthening by the Holy Spirit through prayer and the laying on of hands by a Bishop.

					   	<br>
					    Reception is for those from other denominations who want to formally be received as members into the Episcopal Church. Anyone from another Christian church, if they have been baptized with water and in the name of the Trinity, may become a baptized member of the Episcopal Church by having their baptism duly recorded in this church. Moreover, persons baptized in other traditions may also be received by laying on of hands by a bishop, if such persons have also already made an adult affirmation of faith in their baptized traditions. If they have not, then those persons may be confirmed in this church.</p>
