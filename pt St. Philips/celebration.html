The Catechism of the Episcopal Book of Common Prayer elaborates that, “Holy Baptism is the sacrament by which God adopts us as his children and makes us members of Christ’s Body, the Church, and inheritors of the kingdom of God.”</p>
					    <br>
					    <br>
					    <p>We baptize both adults who have come to have faith in Christ and children whose guardians present them for the sacrament. We believe, that Baptism creates an eternal bond between the person and God. We do not, therefore, re-baptize those who were previously baptized, whether in the Episcopal Church or in another context. We would be delighted to explore with any baptized persons membership in the Episcopal Church.

					    <p>Confirmation and reaffirmation are rites that are meant to help one renew commitments made during baptisms or made on their behalf by parents or others at baptism in the Baptismal Covenant. Confirmation is a declaration of faith and commitment to the Christian life made by someone who has already been baptized but who has now taken the decision for her or himself to follow the way of Jesus and will take the vows of the Baptismal Covenant her or himself. Reaffirmation is for those who have been baptized and confirmed but who, for any number of reasons, want to intentionally renew their commitment to living a Christian life through study and renewal of the Baptismal Covenant vows once again. </p>

Reaffirmation is for those who have been baptized and confirmed but who, for any number of reasons, want to intentionally renew their commitment to living a Christian life through study and renewal of the Baptismal Covenant vows once again. Both confirmation and reaffirmation involve strengthening by the Holy Spirit through prayer and the laying on of hands by a Bishop.
					    <br>
					   	<br>
					    Reception is for those from other denominations who want to formally be received as members into the Episcopal Church. Anyone from another Christian church, if they have been baptized with water and in the name of the Trinity, may become a baptized member of the Episcopal Church by having their baptism duly recorded in this church. Moreover, persons baptized in other traditions may also be received by laying on of hands by a bishop, if such persons have also already made an adult affirmation of faith in their baptized traditions. If they have not, then those persons may be confirmed in this church.</p>

At its General Convention in 2015, the Church made the rites of Holy Matrimony accessible to same-sex as well as at its General Convention in 2015, the Church made the rites of Holy Matrimony accessible to same-sex as well as different-sex couples, and the Cathedral upholds that decision.
