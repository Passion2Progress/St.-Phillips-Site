					<p>“Music at its best ushers us
						<br>
						into the holy, deepens our prayers, heightens our praise, provides an
						<br>
						aura of beauty that reflects the nature of God, lifts us into God’s
						<br>
						presence, and strengthens our bonds with all creation.”
						<br>
						~ Dr. William Bradley Roberts, Virginia Theological Seminary
						<hr>
					<p>
						From centuries’ old traditional Christian hymnody to Anglican chant to Negro
						Spirituals or to more contemporary Gospel hymns, the music at St. Philip’s
						strives to be “music at its best”. Currently, our music program consists of the
						Chancel Choir, the Voices of Praise Contemporary Choir, and the Handbell
						Choir.

					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">Chancel Choir</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The Chancel choir of St. Philip’s sings on the first, second and third Sundays of
					every month, from September – June. It is a group of faithful volunteers who lead
					the worship service singing traditional hymns, anthems and choral mass settings.
					At present, the Chancel choir rehearses on Thursday evenings from 6:00 –
					7:30pm, in addition to a morning rehearsal preceding the 11:15am Eucharist. If
					you wish to join the Chancel choir, you may contact Erik Carlson at 212-862-
					4940.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">Voices of Praise Contemporary Choir</h3>
					<br>
					<p>The Voices of Praise Contemporary Choir leads the congregation in singing on
					the third and fifth Sundays of each month. As their name suggests, this choir
					performs a varied musical selection of both traditional gospel as well as
					contemporary gospel and Christian songs.</p>
					<hr>
					<p>The Voices of Praise Choir rehearses on Friday evenings at 6:00pm. If you are
					interested in singing with the V.O.P. choir, please contact Mr. Charles Lovell at
					the church office, 212-862-4940.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">The Handbell Choir</h3>
					<p>
					The handbell choir is comprised of an enthusiastic, intergenerational group of
					children, teenagers and adults that serve as bell ringers for our three octave set
					of Malmark handbells. The unique sound of handbells provides a beautiful
					accompaniment to the liturgy. The Handbell choir performs at festival services,
					such as the annual service of Advent Lessons and Carols, the Easter service and
					on other special occasions.

					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">The Organ of St. Philip’s</h3>
					<p>
					The historic Aeolian-Skinner organ, designed by the legendary G. Donald
					Harrison and installed in 1952, is the foundation for the music ministry of this
					church. It was considered by organists and organ-builders alike to be quite a
					unique and fine instrument upon its installation, and many noted performers have
					been featured in recital at St. Philip’s. Its classic tonal design provided for a fine
					ensemble of voices which today remain perfect in this great space, designed for
					fine music.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
					The placement of the 39 ranks and four divisions of the organ (Great, Swell,
					Choir and Pedal) in two acoustic chambers to the right and left above the
					Chancel strongly supports congregational singing. In addition, the sounds of the
					instrument so perfectly fill the church that if one is in the Choir Room, below the
					main church and quite far from the organ, the delicate, bright sounds of just the 8′
					and 4′ flutes in the Choir Division can be clearly heard-almost as if they are in the
					room!
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>As well, a Trompette-en-Chamade speaks dramatically from the rear of the nave.
					This elegant stop is considered by many to be the first set of such pipes installed
					by Mr. Harrison in this country.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
					This wonderful instrument has faithfully served St. Philip’s Church for over 50
					years but is now in great need of repair and restoration. YOU can help! In order

					to help restore this great organ and continue a tradition of great music at St.
					Philip’s Church, please consider making a donation. Please make any checks
					payable to “St. Philip’s Church” and write “organ restoration” in the memo.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">Music Events</h3>
					<p>
					Beyond the music that is sung and performed as part of our worship, St. Philip’s
					also offers special concerts and musical events,
