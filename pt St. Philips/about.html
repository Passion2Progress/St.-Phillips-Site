					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">A Liturgical Church</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
					St. Philip’s is a liturgical church, which means we follow fixed orders of service, known as liturgies, which are found in the Book of Common Prayer. The Eucharist is the primary focus of our Sunday worship. The Revised Common Lectionary provides the schedule of Bible Lessons and Psalms to be read on specified days throughout the Church Year.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">What to Expect on Sunday</h3>
					<br>
					<p>St. Philip’s is a diverse, inclusive community committed to welcoming all, praying together, serving our brothers and sisters in need and sharing fellowship.
					<br>
					<br>
					We have all been newcomers and understand that when you are planning to visit a church for the first time, you can have questions.  We hope that you will find the following information helpful.
					<br>
					<br>
					If there are things about our worship that seem difficult and don’t make sense, be patient with the unfamiliarity. Consider that you are entering into a conversation with God and the faithful, which began centuries before we were here and will continue after we are gone. Just join in as you are, and we will all be changed as we go. All who seek God are welcome to the Lord’s Table to receive the Bread and Wine. Even if you do not seek God, you are still welcome because God seeks you. Come and hold in your and taste on your lips the love that we cannot comprehend.
					<br>
					<br>
					We know it can seem daunting to visit a church for the first time, not unlike visiting a foreign country where you are uncertain about the customs and traditions. We hope this brief introduction will make your first visit at St. Philip’s more comfortable.
					</p>
                    <br>
                    
					<p>At 9am, We offer a said service of Holy Eucharist; that is, a spoken worship service of Holy Eucharist (Communion) with prayers and a sermon but without hymns or music. This service is often attractive to those who prefer and/or who wish, from time to time, to experience a more contemplative service of prayer and reflection.</p>
                    <br>

					<p>At 11:00am, We offer a choral Holy Eucharist, which features hymns led by one of our choirs, and which periodically includes the use of incense and communal chanting of certain sections of the worship service. Specifically, worship is led by the Chancel Choir on the first, second and fourth Sundays and by the Voices of Praise contemporary choir on the third and fifth Sundays.</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">The Service Bulletin, The Book of Common Prayer, The Hymnal 1982 and LEVAS 
						<br>(Lift Every Voice and Sing)</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
					Our weekly service bulletin provides an outline of the service with page references to the Book of Common Prayer and the Hymnal 1982 and LEVAS to enable you to follow the order of service. You will find a friendly community at St. Philip’s—if you need help finding your place in the service, just ask anyone seated around you. They will be happy to help you!
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">The Sign of the Cross</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
					Many people at St. Philip’s follow the ancient custom of making the sign of the cross at various points in the service, in remembrance of their Baptism.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3 class="mission-sub-border">Two Sunday Morning Services 
												<br>and Christian Education</h3> 
					<br>
					<p>Our 9 a.m. service is the smaller of our two Sunday services, and it is done without music. The 11:00 a.m. service, our main service, is a Choral Eucharist with the St. Philip’s Choir (during the academic year), or with music by small ensembles (during the summer months). The congregation joins in the hymns and canticles at the 11:00 a.m. liturgy, and you will find us to be good singers!
					<br>
					<br>
					Church School (for children) takes place during the first half of the 11:00 a.m. Eucharist; the children then join their families in church after the sermon to participate in the remainder of the service. Ask an usher to direct you to the Church School classrooms. Parents are also welcome to bring their children to church for the entire service.

					“Music at its best ushers us

					<p>
					From centuries’ old traditional Christian hymnody to Anglican chant to Negro
					Spirituals or to more contemporary Gospel hymns, the music at St. Philip’s
					strives to be “music at its best”. Currently, our music program consists of the
					Chancel Choir, the Voices of Praise Contemporary Choir, and the Handbell

						<br>
					<p>
					The Chancel choir of St. Philip’s sings on the first, second and third Sundays of
					every month, from September – June. It is a group of faithful volunteers who lead
					the worship service singing traditional hymns, anthems and choral mass settings.
					At present, the Chancel choir rehearses on Thursday evenings from 6:00 –
					7:30pm, in addition to a morning rehearsal preceding the 11:15am Eucharist. If
					you wish to join the Chancel choir, you may contact Erik Carlson at 212-862-

					The Voices of Praise Contemporary Choir leads the congregation in singing on

					performs a varied musical selection of both traditional gospel as well as

					</p>
	<span class="space"></span>
					<p>
					The Voices of Praise Choir rehearses on Friday evenings at 6:00pm. If you are

				<h3 class="mission-sub-border">The Handbell Choir</h3>
	<span class="space"></span>
					<p>
					The handbell choir is comprised of an enthusiastic, intergenerational group of
					children, teenagers and adults that serve as bell ringers for our three octave set
					of Malmark handbells. The unique sound of handbells provides a beautiful
					accompaniment to the liturgy. The Handbell choir performs at festival services,
					such as the annual service of Advent Lessons and Carols, the Easter service and
					on other special occasions.

				<h3 class="mission-sub-border">The Organ of St. Philip’s</h3>
					<p>
					The historic Aeolian-Skinner organ, designed by the legendary G. Donald
					Harrison and installed in 1952, is the foundation for the music ministry of this
					church. It was considered by organists and organ-builders alike to be quite a
					unique and fine instrument upon its installation, and many noted performers have
					been featured in recital at St. Philip’s. Its classic tonal design provided for a fine
					ensemble of voices which today remain perfect in this great space, designed for
					fine music.
					</p>
	<span class="space"></span>
					<p>
					The placement of the 39 ranks and four divisions of the organ (Great, Swell,
					Choir and Pedal) in two acoustic chambers to the right and left above the
					Chancel strongly supports congregational singing. In addition, the sounds of the
					instrument so perfectly fill the church that if one is in the Choir Room, below the
					main church and quite far from the organ, the delicate, bright sounds of just the 8′
					and 4′ flutes in the Choir Division can be clearly heard-almost as if they are in theroom!
					</p>
	<span class="space"></span>
					<p>As well, a Trompette-en-Chamade speaks dramatically from the rear of the nave.
					This elegant stop is considered by many to be the first set of such pipes installed
					by Mr. Harrison in this country.
					</p>
	<span class="space"></span>
					<p>
					This wonderful instrument has faithfully served St. Philip’s Church for over 50
					years but is now in great need of repair and restoration. YOU can help! In order
					to help restore this great organ and continue a tradition of great music at St.
					Philip’s Church, please consider making a donation. Please make any checks
					payable to “St. Philip’s Church” and write “organ restoration” in the memo.

    <p class="mission-top-sub">The St. Philip’s Credit Union was organized in 1951 to enable parishioners of  St. Philip’s Church to invest their savings and obtain credit on affordable terms. Responding to the difficulty faced by many African-Americans in saving or borrowing money at commercial banks, the founders of the Credit Union started the organization with only $100.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Credit Union is a federally-chartered financial institution. All deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Over the years, the Credit Union has grown to over $1.5 million in assets. Its mission is to encourage thrift among its members, and to assist them in developing a sound financial understanding. Membership in the Credit Union is open to all members of St. Philip’s Church. Parishioners can earn competitive rates on their savings, and borrow at reasonable interest rates for a variety of purposes.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Credit Union is affiliated with St. Philip’s Church, but is independently managed by a Board of Directors composed of eight members of the church. The Credit Union is open on Wednesdays from 5:30-7:30 p.m. and on Sundays from 12:00-2:00 p.m.</p>
