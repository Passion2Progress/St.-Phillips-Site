Wants the homepage to be a picture of the logo symbol, 
the church. 

A carousel of the pictures of the church 
outside and inside and various spots inside the church. 

Maybe 2 to 4 pictures. 

For the email subscription page, maybe on the side events 
could be there. 

Might want to put the calendar in later on. 
An events calendar on the side of the homepage 
would be better.

Give history its own tab. Possibly include some 
of the pictures from the parish profiles in that tab. 

She has to decide what to put in the news tab.

She wants email subscription under social media. 

If events are out onto the home page, can people 
click on the event and get an expanded view. 

Wouldn't mind having anyone have access to the 
celebration page. 

Make giving a separate tab.

Ministries as a separate tab which includes all 
the things on the website.  


Home, About, Giving, Ministries, and Contact 
( Looking for a church ) are all tabs. inistries


Celebrations could be under giving.  


Anyone can access inspiration words from forward movement.
